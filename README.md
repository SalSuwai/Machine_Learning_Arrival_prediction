## Project Summary:
Analyzing a dataset that shows the information of patients of a hospital and shows whether the patient arrived at their booked appointment or not. The goal of this project is to build a Machine learning model that can predict whether the patient with the given info will arrive or not. 

# Project: Patient Arrival Prediction-Model


In this Project I will analyze, wrangle and clean the dataset of patients of a hospital that shows data about the patient and whether the patient arrived at their scheduled appointment or not. After making the data ready for processing I will be testing various model candidates and will be choosing the best model that can predict the arrival. After getting the golden model I will export the model into a PKL file to be shown on a  UI web page using Flask.

● Scholarship: True or False, indicates if the patient is in the Bolsa Familia program 

● Hipertension: True or False

 ● Diabetes: True or False
 
 ● Alcoholism: True or False
 
 ● Handcap: handicap level of severeness (5 levels)
 
 ● SMS_received: 1 or more messages sent to the patient
